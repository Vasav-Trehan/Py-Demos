### Everybody loves profit. But what exactly is profit, how to calculate it? Let me help you! There are 3 parameters in calculating profit. So, let’s start!

# Profit
**Suppose you are a shopkeeper and you sell mobile phones. As you’re the shopkeeper you’ll not manufacture mobiles. There are several companies which manufacture phones for example Mi. If you’re selling phones you’ll buy in bulk to sell it to many customers. This is called the inventory or in simple words quantity of goods. As you’re purchasing in bulk you’ll get 1 mobile at a much lesser price. This less price is called the Cost Price. Now a customer or consumer comes to your shop and asks for a mobile XYZ. You will not sell the mobile at the price you bought.**

**In India, the Government sets a price for each product officially called the ‘MRP’ or Maximum Retail Price’ which is inclusive of all taxes. You can’t even charge a single extra penny over the MRP. However, you can give a discount! Suppose you bought 1 phone at 5000 Rs and the MRP is 7000. You Sold the product at the MRP so the MRP is the selling price. Profit is the difference between the cost price and the selling price. If the selling price is higher than the cost price then you’re profit else loss.**

**Cost Price: The price for 1 product at which the shopkeeper purchases goods in bulk is called the cost price.**

### TOPICS DISCUSSED

1. **Selling Price: The price at which the shopkeeper sells the goods is Selling price.**

2. **Inventory/Quantity/Stock: The amount of goods available right now is called the stock.**

3. **Formula: (SP(Selling Price) – CP(Cost Price)) * Inventory**

### For example:

**_CP = 5000 RS_**

**_SP = 7000 RS_**

**_Stock = 10_**

**_Profit = (SP – CP) * Stock_**

**_=(7000 – 5000) * 10 _**

**_=2000 * 10_** 

**_=20000 RS_**
